# JavaScriptMostWanted
dCC JavaScript Group project w/ Rakesh


Requirements:
Goal 1 — User Interface — Fork the repo and review the existing code. Your first goal is to build out
the user interface (UI) using alerts and prompts.
The user should first be able to search for a person by name or by traits (see goal 5). Then they
should be able to look up that person’s information, the names of their descendants, and the names
of their immediate family members.
The user interface you develop should be intuitive and not leave room for confusion. If a user enters
something incorrectly, give them a message explaining what they may have done wrong, and prompt
them again. Make sure you handle errors ‘gracefully’.
Goal 2 —Get A Person’s Info— Build out the functionality for displaying a person’s information from
their full name (first and last).
Goal 3 —Get Descendants— Build out the functionality for returning a person’s descendants. The
user just needs the list of their full names. Descendants are limited to relatives ‘by blood’. Must use
recursion.
Goal 4 —Get Family— Build out the functionality for returning a person’s immediate family. The user
just needs the list of their full names. Immediate family includes a person’s parents, siblings, spouse
(current only), and children. Must use iteration.
Goal 5 —Search and Filter— Build out the functionality for finding a person based on search
criteria. The user may enter multiple (up to 5) characteristics of a user. The user should get a list of
people back that meet all of the criteria. Must use some combination of Array.Map( ) and
Array.Filter( ).
